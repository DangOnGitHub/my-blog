        I feel lucky that I had a chance to study information technology at
        RMIT. At first, I struggled with programming but it slowly grew on me.
        Now I think I enjoy writing code more and following up with technology
        industry. Working as a software engineer also gives me a decent living
        and autonomy in my work (a rare good combination).

        When I graduated from my university, I started as an iOS developer. I
        didn&apos;t learn iOS at school but self-studying and writing a small
        iOS app landed me the internship as an iOS developer which eventually
        led to my first job. I was quite satified building iOS app for a long
        time. It was enjoyable to see and experience what you build. However, in
        2020, my interest changed as I worked closely with backend team and
        learnt more about cloud technology. I noticed that from the backend
        side, they have different challenges and practices to deal with
        today&apos;s demanding requirements of a modern app. These things are
        intriguing enough to catch my attention. Thereafter, I explored
        different roles that can work more with cloud technology and became a
        backend developer as of now.
